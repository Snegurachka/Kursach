Computer-aided design (CAD) is the use of computer systems to aid in the creation, modification, analysis, or optimization of a design.[1] C
AD software is used to increase the productivity of the designer, improve the quality of design, improve communications through documentation,
and to create a database for manufacturing.[2] CAD output is often in the form of electronic files for print, machining, or other manuf
acturing operations.

Computer-aided design is used in many fields. Its use in designing electronic systems is known as electronic design automation, or EDA.
In mechanical design it is known as mechanical design automation (MDA) or computer-aided design (CAD), which includes the process of
creating a technical drawing with the use of computer software.[3]

CAD software for mechanical design uses either vector-based graphics to depict the objects of traditional drafting, or may also produce
raster graphics showing the overall appearance of designed objects. However, it involves more than just shapes. As in the manual drafting of technical and engineering drawings, the output of CAD must convey information, such as materials, processes, dimensions, and tolerances, according to application-specific conventions.

CAD may be used to design curves and figures in two-dimensional (2D) space; or curves, surfaces, and solids in three-dimensional (3D) sp
ace.[4]

CAD is an important industrial art extensively used in many applications, including automotive, shipbuilding, and aerospace industries,
industrial and architectural design, prosthetics, and many more. CAD is also widely used to produce computer animation for special effe
cts in movies, advertising and technical manuals, often called DCC digital content creation. The modern ubiquity and power of computers
means that even perfume bottles and shampoo dispensers are designed using techniques unheard of by engineers of the 1960s. Because of it
s enormous economic importance, CAD has been a major driving force for research in computational geometry, computer graphics (both hard
ware and software), and discrete differential geometry.[5]

The design of geometric models for object shapes, in particular, is occasionally called computer-aided geometric design (CAGD).[6]
